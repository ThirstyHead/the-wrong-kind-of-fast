            But isn't React's Virtual DOM faster than the browser-native DOM? Dan Abramov -- creator of Redux and top committer to React -- gives a quiet, thoughtful, even-handed response to this.
            </p>

            <p>
              "We don't claim that React is faster than the native DOM. React can't be faster than the same DOM manipulations by hand, because [React] by definition has to do more work."
            </p>

            <p>
              "We do think that it helps create maintainable app. React is fast enough..."
