            The "Web Quality Curve" closely matches the "Waffle Quality Curve".

              There are "frozen waffle" web solutions out there, like WordPress and Docker. These pre-built solutions are fast, but at what cost? (We'll discuss the costs in just a moment.)
            </p>

            <p>
              There are "box mix" web solutions out there like React, Angular, and Vue. Now, don't get upset. I'm not saying that these frameworks are bad, or that you're bad for using them. I'm saying that they are general-purpose, "jack of all trades, master of none" frameworks that are nearly always more than you need to solve your specific problem at hand.
            </p>

            <p>
              And think about it -- when is the last time you went out to a fancy restaurant for breakfast, and they served you waffles from a boxed mix? A purpose-built, custom "Waffles of Insane Greatness" solution is almost always going to be better than a general-purpose, ill-fitting, "off the rack" solution.
