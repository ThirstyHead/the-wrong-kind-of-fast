            At first glance, it might look like this recipe is more complicated than the Bisquick one. But in practice, it still only takes about 5 minutes of prep time.

              But notice the premium ingredients: cornstarch makes the waffle light and crispy. Buttermilk adds a richness. Sugar and vanilla add a hint of sweetness that was missing from the Bisquick waffles.

              And notice that this recipe serves 4, not twelve. So for roughly the same amount of work, we got a dramatically better waffle, and a batch that was the perfect size for our family.
