            After a while, my wife and I decided to try a box mix for waffles. "Bisquick" -- Look! There's "quick", right in the name!
            </p>

              There aren't too many ingredients, so the prep time was fast. We could whip up a batch in 5 minutes, and in another 5 minutes the kids had fresh-made waffles on the table.

              However, we ran into problems with Bisquick as well. Notice that the recipe serves 12 -- we only needed 4, but it's hard to use a third of an egg.
