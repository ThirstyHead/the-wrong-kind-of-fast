            Which brings us to the "Waffle Quality Curve". Notice that frozen waffles are definitely the fastest, but they are also the lowest quality. That's what we started calling, "the wrong kind of fast" at home.

              The box mix takes a little bit more prep time, but it definitely increases the quality.

              But once we discovered that we could use a purpose-built recipe -- one that was specifically for waffles, and one that really didn't take much longer than the box mix -- we were sold. We realized that we weren't as busy as the advertising told us we were, and the quality of the waffles absolutely justified the time spent on the process.
