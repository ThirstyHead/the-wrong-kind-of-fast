            Many of my clients use React. Very few of them use React Native, and almost none of them use React Server-Side Rendering. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The whole point of React abstracting away the real, browser-native DOM in favor of a "Virtual DOM" is to build many clients from the same code base. You know, like Bisquick. If you're not building out muliple clients, then you are paying all of the overhead costs of the framework and only reaping a tiny fraction of the reward.
