# The Wrong Kind of Fast: Embracing Evidence-Based Architecture

"Move fast and break things" was Facebook's motto for years, valuing time-to-market over stability. "React is faster than the DOM" is one of the commonly repeated features of the framework, although this is demonstrably untrue and disavowed by Dan Abramov, top React committer and creator of Redux. 

Of course we want software to be fast, but we should want it to be the right kind of fast. In this keynote, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) debunks common software tropes with empirical, quantifiable, measurable facts -- what he calls "Evidence-Based Architecture". We'll look at making your web app fast by creating measurable performance budgets. We'll explore your development process through the prism of the book "Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations". And we'll create "objective integrity assessments" through measurable Fitness Functions, as discussed in the book "Building Evolutionary Architectures: Support Constant Change".
